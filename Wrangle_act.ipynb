    "# Data Wrangling \n",

    "   ## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. You will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because \"they're good dogs Brent.\" WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for you to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. More on this soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to wrangle data from WeRateDogs Twitter's account using Python and document the whole process in a Jupyter Notebook named wrangle_act.ipynb i.e. this notebook. My aim is to wrangle this data for interesting and trustworthy analyses using visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ## Project Details\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Fully assessing and cleaning the entire dataset would require exceptional effort so only a subset of its issues (eight quality issues and two tidiness issues at minimum)needed to be assessed and cleaned.The tasks for this project were:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Data wrangling which consist of:\n",
    "        a. Data Gathering \n",
    "        b. Data Acessing \n",
    "        c. Data Cleaning.\n",

    "  ### Enhanced Twitter Archive\n",
    "  \n",
    "The **WeRateDogs** Twitter archive provided by Udacity. This contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets, but not everything.I manually downloaded this file manually **twitter_archive_enhanced.csv**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### Image Predictions File\n",
    "\n",
    "The tweet image predictions, i.e., what breed of dog (or other object, animal, etc.) is present in each tweet according to a neural network. This file (image_predictions.tsv) is hosted on Udacity's servers and should be downloaded programmatically using the Requests library and the following URL: \n",

    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    " ### Additional Data via the Twitter API( Tweepy)\n",
    " \n",
    "Each tweet's retweet count and favorite (\"like\") count at minimum, and any additional data you find interesting. Using the tweet IDs in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive, query the Twitter API for each tweet's JSON data using Python's Tweepy library and store each tweet's entire set of JSON data in a file called **tweet_json.txt** file. Each tweet's JSON data should be written to its own line. Then read this .txt file line by line into a pandas DataFrame with (at minimum) tweet ID, retweet count, and favorite count.\n",
